git init
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin 'https://github.com/arshahrear30/miniexel.git'
git push -u origin main



git checkout -b main
git push -u origin main

Detached HEAD থেকে বের হবে
Local main branch তৈরি হবে
Future এ শুধু git push লিখলেই হবে



Everyday code update workflow
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push


error rejected (fetch first)
git pull origin main
git push



error text : 
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
Solution : 
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
